                It is a belief as old as the first shadow cast by firelight: the body is a sacred vessel. Before we built temples of stone, the first altar was the self—the form that carries our spirit through the world. In ancient traditions, to adorn this form was not vanity, but a ritual of reverence.
            </p>

            <p class="lore-paragraph emphasis">
                From this belief came the Votivas.
            </p>

            <p class="lore-paragraph">
                They were not merely ornaments, but votive offerings made to one's own journey. Artisans, known only as the Form-smiths, would forge relics in the shape of the body itself—the graceful curve of an ear, the expressive gesture of a hand, the parted line of the lips. These were created not as finished pieces, but as "forms in waiting," pure and unmarked.
            </p>

            <p class="lore-paragraph emphasis quote-callout">
                A Votiva was considered a silent promise. It was the wearer who gave it a voice.
            </p>

            <p class="lore-paragraph">
                The final act of creation was a personal ritual. By adding a piercing or setting a stone, the wearer would mark the piece with their own story—a vow of intent, a whisper of a memory, a scar of a lesson learned. Each mark was a sigil of the self, transforming the Votiva from a beautiful object into an intimate extension of their being. The adornment was not complete until it was touched by the soul of its keeper.
            </p>

            <p class="lore-paragraph emphasis">
                VOTIVA is the echo of this lost art.
            </p>

            <p class="lore-paragraph">
                We are the modern Form-smiths, crafting these sacred vessels for you. We provide the timeless form, forged with intention and respect for the craft. But the final design, the true meaning, belongs to you.
            </p>

            <p class="lore-paragraph emphasis quote-callout">
                We create the vessel. You provide the spirit.
            </p>

            <p class="lore-paragraph closing">
                Adorn the form, design the self.
